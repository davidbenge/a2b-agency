# Merge Checklist for Brand Manager Demo Mode

## üìã Feature Summary

### Brand Manager Demo Mode Overview
The Brand Manager Demo Mode is a development-friendly feature that enables UI development and testing without backend dependencies. It provides:

**üéØ Core Benefits:**
- **Zero Backend Setup**: Work with mock data without authentication or API setup
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, view, and delete brands with realistic mock data
- **Real-time UI Testing**: Hot reload with instant feedback on component changes
- **Safe Development**: No risk of affecting production data or breaking existing functionality

**üîß Key Features:**
- **Environment-Controlled**: Enabled via `REACT_APP_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=true` in `.env`
- **Production Safe**: Automatically disabled in production environments
- **Defensive Programming**: Safe property access prevents runtime crashes
- **Clear Indicators**: UI clearly shows when running in demo mode

**üìÅ Components Enhanced:**
- `BrandManagerView.tsx`: Table with sorting, filtering, search, and CRUD operations
- `BrandForm.tsx`: Form component with validation and mode switching
- `App.js`: Safe property access to prevent undefined errors

**üöÄ Development Workflow:**
1. Set environment variable for demo mode
2. Start development server with `aio app run -e dx/excshell/1`
3. Navigate to Brand Manager via left navigation
4. Test all functionality with mock data
5. Iterate on UI components with hot reload
